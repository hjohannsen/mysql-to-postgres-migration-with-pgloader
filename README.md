Migrating An Acrolinx Reporting Database From MySQL To Postgres With PGLoader
================================================================================

The [Acrolinx Platform's][acrolinx] [backup/restore mechanism][acrolinx-docs-reporting-backups] for the reporting database is designed to work with _all_ supported database servers. In all directions.
That high degree of flexibility comes at the price of moderate performance.
If you need to migrate a large reporting database from MySQL to Postgres, using the [PGLoader][pgloader-github] might be the better option for you. 
This project provides a tested example of how to do that.

Preliminary Considerations
---------------------------
:warning: The [builtin backup/restore utility][acrolinx-docs-reporting-backups] also covers [custom analytics reports][acrolinx-docs-custom-analytics-dashboards]. 
The PGLoader is entirely unaware of those reports. 
They won't be migrated.

Use PGLoader only to migrate the _reporting_ database. 
[For the terminology database the built-in tool is the better option.][acrolinx-docs-terminology-backups]

You don't need to migrate the [JReport databases][acrolinx-docs-connect-external-dbs]. 
Those are ephemeral.

How To
--------
### Install PGLoader And MySQL Client

Install PGLoader as described [here][pgloader-github-installation].
You might also need the [mysql][mysql-dev-docs-getting-started] client.

### Create The PGLoader Configuration

#### From Template

This project contains a PGLoader configuration template at `src/templates/cfg.load`.

That template has the following placeholders, which can _mostly_ be passed as [environment variables or per INI file][pgloader-github-templating] (:warning: except one):
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__SRC_USER`: MySQL user
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__SRC_PW`: MySQL password
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__SRC_HOST`: MySQL host
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__SRC_PORT`: MySQL port
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__SRC_DB`: MySQL database name
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__TARGET_USER`: Postgres user
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__TARGET_PW`: Postgres password
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__TARGET_HOST`: Postgres host
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__TARGET_PORT`: Postgres port
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__TARGET_DB`: Postgres database name
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__MYSQL_TIMEOUT`: MySQL [net_read_timeout and net_write_timeout][mysql-docs-system-variables] setting
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__PG_WORK_MEM`: Postgres [work_mem][postgres-docs-resource-consumption] setting
* `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__MAX_SEQ`: 
  * New value for the `seq_gen_sequence` in Postgres (see further below)
  * :warning: Not expandable from environment variable
  * :point_right: Needs manual replacement

For convenience, this project contains a little tool that expands template placeholders in an interactive way and creates an expanded output file:
* `chmod 755 bin/expand-cfg-interactive`
* `./bin/expand-cfg-interactive`  
  
#### Which Sequence Value?

In Postgres, the Acrolinx Platform uses only one sequence object (`seq_gen_sequence`). 
That sequence needs to be reset to a sufficiently high value after importing the data. 

(In the MySQL source database primary keys (PKs) were incremented per table. 
In the target database, the highest of those source PKs should be the basis of the next global sequence value.
We weren't able to accomplish such a mapping automatically in the test setup, however. 
Inspiration is always welcome.)

The `cfg.load` configuration sets the sequence to the value specified in `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__MAX_SEQ` after importing the data.

But what value should be entered in the first place? 
To find the maximum PK in the source database, we added a procedure: `src/mysql/max-id-procedure.txt`:
* Connect to the source database with the [mysql][mysql-dev-docs-getting-started] client.
* `source src/mysql/max-id-procedure.txt`
* `CALL acrolinxMaxId(@max_id_in_database);`
* `SELECT @max_id_in_database;`
* `DROP PROCEDURE acrolinxMaxId;`

Add a buffer to the result and use it as parameter `ACROLINX_MYSQL_PG__MAX_SEQ`.


### Prepare The Target Database

The Acrolinx Platform needs particular index names in Postgres.
Those may differ from the MySQL index names.
Therefore, we recommend letting the Acrolinx Core Server create the target database schema.
And to migrate only the data with PGLoader.

To do so, perform the following steps:
* Start a Core Platform with the same version as with the source database against the target database. 
* Wait a few seconds.
* Stop the server again when seeing this in the `coreserver.log`: `Reporting database version OK!` 

### Migrate

#### In Short
Assuming you created a PGLoader configuration `cfg.load` as described above, run 

```pgloader -v cfg.load```

#### Full Flow
Here's the full procedure:
* Install PGLoader and the MySQL client.
* Clone this repository.
* CD into the root folder.
* Find out highest MySQL PK as described above.
* Generate the configuration from template as described above.
* Run `pgloader -v cfg.load`.

### Disclaimer

The migration steps above represent the first migration path we could get to work.
Complexity was added as we were facing problems in the evaluation experiments.
We're not perfect.
We don't claim it can't be simplified.
